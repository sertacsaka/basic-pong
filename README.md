## An Android clone of classic arcade sports video game

Back in 2016, I coded it using Aide on a second-hand Asus Transformer Pad TF701T and put it on Google Play. Then, because I didn't follow it, I wasn't aware of many requirements like the privacy policy, content and the age range statement that Google put into effect, and as a result, it was removed from Google Play.
Now, with Android Studio, I've overhauled the code a bit and got it up and running again.
